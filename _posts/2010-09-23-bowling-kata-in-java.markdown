*Note:* It's better to watch the video on [Vimeo's website](http://vimeo.com/15239027) since Vimeo does not allow HD embedding for free users.

Here is my attempt to perform [Uncle Bob's Bowling Kata in Java](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

I used IntelliJ as my IDE and music by [The Sight Below](http://ghostly.com/artists/the-sight-below).  His live set can be downloaded for free [here](http://soundcloud.com/modyfier/the-sight-below-process-part-200-live-at-the-seattle-art-museum).  If you don't like the music, feel free to put it on mute.

I encourage you to watch the video while looking at Uncle Bob's notes in the [powerpoint presentation](http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt).
