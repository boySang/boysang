I was one of the lucky ones to contribute to The Software Testing Club's first [magazine](http://wiki.softwaretestingclub.com/The+Software+Testing+Club+Magazine+-+No+1) that released today for free.  In it, you will find a small Twitter conversation I had with [@QualityFrog](http://twitter.com/QualityFrog/) as well as a Google Wave conversation I had with [@Rob_Lambert](http://twitter.com/Rob_Lambert/) and [@YorkyAbroad](http://twitter.com/YorkyAbroad/).  I look forward to future contributions to this wonderful magazine.  Be sure to check out the bottom-left hand corner every other page to find humorous quotes.
