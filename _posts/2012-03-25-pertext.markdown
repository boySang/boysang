[pertext](https://github.com/sl4m/pertext) is a [PERT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique) estimation tool as a Chrome extension.

This was pulled from my ideas list and the main motivation was to learn how to create Chrome extensions.  What I found out from this
little exercise is that a Chrome extension is nothing more than just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript packaged together in `crx` file.
It's basically like a static-based website living in your browser.  You can have it call out to a server, read data from each
browser tab, etc.  pertext is just a simple calculator, so everything is localized.

Check out the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pertext) and try it out by visiting the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jbbmfopbiibcgfedhckafpgbpmagljjh).  I've written unit
tests for the PERT library using Jasmine, created Rake tasks to essentially package the extension for testing and deployment
(modeled off of this [Rakefile](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_client_side_encryption/blob/master/Rakefile), and used
Braintree's [git workflow](http://www.braintreepayments.com/devblog/our-git-workflow) with bitbucket as the acting private repo.

All in all, this was a fun little exercise and I look forward to creating another Chrome extension soon.
