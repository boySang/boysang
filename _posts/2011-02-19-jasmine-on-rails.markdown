My first 8LU ([8th Light](http://8thlight.com/) University) series was on Jasmine.  I learned Jasmine on a recent Rails 3 project and found it be a nice addition to the testing arsenal.  There are still some quirks with the framework, but the Pivotal guys are behind it and it can be used now in any project.  I look forward to using it more in future projects.

The slides are online [here](http://jor.heroku.com/).  The slides repo is [here](https://github.com/sl4m/jasmine_on_rails3_slides).
