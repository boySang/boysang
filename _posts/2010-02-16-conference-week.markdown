This week will be a busy week of information overload - a week of Ruby and Rails conferences.  This Thursday, the free [Rails Online Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/railswinter10) will exclusively be about the upcoming version of Rails.  Currently, it is in its beta state and will be officially available soon.  I look forward to the talks and to learn more about the new features in Rails 3.

[LA Ruby Conference 2010](http://larubyconf.com/) will be on Saturday and the complementary workshops will be held on Friday.  I signed up for both Ruby Koans and Intro to Ruby on Rails workshops which I'm both pretty excited about.  Jim Weirich and Joe O'Brien will give the Ruby Koans workshop, and Alf Mikula (LA Ruby meetup organizer) will give the Intro to Ruby on Rails workshop.

Here are the talks I'm particularly interested in:

* [Oh S\*\*\*: How to bring a big Rails website down \(and how not to\)](http://larubyconf.com/presentations/2)
* [Alternative Data Structures in Ruby](http://larubyconf.com/presentations/3)
* [Everything you ever wanted to know about threads and fibers, but were afraid to ask](http://larubyconf.com/presentations/5)
* [Garbage Collection and the Ruby Heap](http://larubyconf.com/presentations/9)
* [A New Look at Software Development: What will the next 10 years bring?](http://larubyconf.com/presentations/10)

I look forward to meeting more Rubyists.
