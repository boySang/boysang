Last week, I accepted a software apprenticeship offer at [8th Light](http://8thlight.com/) and will be starting next month.  It's really exciting to [be the worst](http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/ch04.html#be_the_worst) again and I look forward to the challenges ahead.  I plan to write about my experience as a software apprentice in a different blog.  If you'd like, bookmark the url below.
