I finally got [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and github working together thanks to [Chris Parson's](http://chrismdp.github.com/) github pages.  I might throw this on [codaset](http://codaset.com/skim/skim_pages) after I'm more familiar with jekyll, but in the meantime, this will do.  Now I need to figure out how to link this to my domain...
